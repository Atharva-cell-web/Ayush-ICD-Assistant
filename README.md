AYUSH-ICD Assistant

Bridging Traditional Wisdom with Modern Healthcare Standards.

---

ABOUT THE PROJECT

The AYUSH-ICD Assistant is a web-based application designed to bridge the gap between traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) and global healthcare standards.

Currently, traditional practitioners use NAMASTE codes (Ayush terminology), while modern hospitals and insurance companies use WHO ICD-11 codes. This creates a gap in patient records and data interoperability.

This project solves that problem by providing a digital tool that automatically maps traditional diagnoses to their modern equivalents, ensuring seamless integration into Electronic Medical Records (EMR).

KEY FEATURES

- Smart Disease Mapping: Instantly searches for diseases (e.g., "Amavata", "Jwara") and retrieves the corresponding Standardized Ayurveda Terminology Code (SAT).
- Dual-Coding Output: Displays the Ayush Code alongside the WHO ICD-11 Code to facilitate universal understanding.
- Confidence Scoring: Uses a simulated AI logic to display a "Match Confidence" percentage, helping practitioners gauge the accuracy of the mapping.
- Search Interactivity: Features a dynamic search bar with auto-suggestions for quick lookup.
- Digitization Ready: Formats data in a way that can be easily saved to hospital databases.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

This project was built using the MERN Stack to ensure a robust and scalable architecture:

- Frontend: React.js, Vite (for fast, responsive UI).
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js (REST API handling).
- Database: MongoDB (storing disease mappings and codes).
- Styling: CSS3 (custom responsive design).

FUTURE SCOPE

- Integration with real-time API for live ICD-11 updates.
- User authentication for doctors to save patient history.
- Expansion to include Unani and Siddha medicine systems.
